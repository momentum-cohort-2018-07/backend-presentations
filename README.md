# Technical topic presentations

## Details

Research and present a technical topic in class. You'll spend time reading up on the topic in Rails Guides and other sources, learning why it's important and what a Rails developer should know about it. Presentations will be during class time following morning lab review.

The goal of this assignment is to give you practice doing research and speaking to a technically-savvy audience about a technical topic.

Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation on your topic. **Your presentation is required to include code**. You don't have to have written it, but you do have to explain it.

Guidelines for your talk (you don't need to do all of these things, but you will need to do most of them to cover your topic effectively):

- Give an overview of your topic in simple language
- What is interesting about your topic to you?
- Why is it important or useful to know about?
- Highlight at least one clear takeaway for your audience.
- Make a recommendation for how your fellow developers can get put these concepts to use.
- Show some code to demonstrate your topic. Options for this include:
  - Show code you wrote or code you found online, as long as you can explain it
  - Write code on the whiteboard or show it in your editor on the projector
- Be ready to answer questions as best as you can at the end of your presentation
- Please provide a list of references for your topic. You are welcome to consult books, and any links you have will be added to the student knowledge base.

For this round, you'll select your own topic. You're welcome to consult with me or Clinton if you need help choosing a topic.

Some guidelines:

- The field is open for whatever you are interested in, including a topic we have covered in class that you'd like to revisit.
- There are no limitations to Ruby, Rails, or even backend, but it should be relevant to web development in general.
- No two people can do the same topic.

**Please let me know what topic you would like to present on by _Wednesday, September 12_**.
